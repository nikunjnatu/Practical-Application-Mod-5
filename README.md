# Practical-Application-Mod-5
This is the Practical application in which a survey data is analyzed to determine which drivers will accept what type of coupon

## Files:
1. **pa5_1.ipynb** - jupyter notebook used for anlyzing the coupons data  
2. **data/coupons.csv** - data file having survey data


## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
### 1. Investigating the dataset for missing or problematic data

* Dropped 'Car' column since it had 99.14% missing records

### 2. Visualizing coupon column data

### 2. Bar coupon acceptance rate of "drivers going to bar 3 or fewer times a month" VS "drivers going to bar more than 3 times a month"

### 3. Bar coupon acceptance rate of "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25" to the "all others"

### 4. Bar coupon acceptance rate of "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid" VS "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry"

### 5. Bar coupon acceptance rate of "drivers who go to a bar more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and were not widowed" VS "drivers who go to bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30" VS "drivers who go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and income is less than 50K"

## Insights based on Bar coupon data analysis
* Bar coupon acceptance rate of drivers who went to a bar more than 3 times a month is **39.82% higher** than than the drivers who went to bar less than than 3 times a month  
* Bar coupon acceptance rate of drivers who went to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 is **36.08% higher** than other drivers
